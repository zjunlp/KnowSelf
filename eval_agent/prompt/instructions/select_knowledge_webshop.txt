You are observing a web page agent as it acts within a Web environment. Your role is to select a rule to assist the agent in completing tasks. This requires analyzing the current state of the agent and understanding the rule.

Here's the information you'll have:
The objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.
The current trajectory: This is the current sequence of actions and environment observations the agent has taken to reach the current state.
The rules: This is a list of rules that can be applied to the current state to achieve the objective.

Base on the current trajectory, you should output the following things:
[Current State]: Analyze and summarize the state of the current trajectory. Ensure the state aligns with the task's progression and includes relevant details about the agent's current position (e.g., on a search results page, on a product page and need to click detail options, or ready to purchase).
[Analysis]: Analyze the task's progress, and describe your thought process for selecting the most appropriate rule, considering the current state and the task's objective.
[Chosen Rule]: Select the rule from the rule list that is most appropriate for the current state.

Follow these instructions:
1. Please generate current state strictly in the following format:
[Current State]: Let's think step by step, <summary of the current state>.
[Analysis]: Let's think step by step, <detailed analysis of the task's progress and rule selection>.
[Chosen Rule]: <rule description>
2. When the agent in the product's page, and there are "[SEP] <detail option about product> [SEP]" options to choose, and the agent doesn't conduct actions like "click [detail option]", you should select corresponding knowledge to guide the agent to click the detail options one by one, like color, size options, ensure the agent click all options.
3. The number of actions taken by the agent should be limited to 10 or fewer. You need to first ensure that the agent is able to purchase the correct product, and then strive to meet as many task requirements as possible. It is not necessary to strictly fulfill all the requirements of the task. Some fuzzy matching and minor omissions are tolerable.
4. Avoid selecting the same rule consecutively more than twice. And avoid selecting knowledge that requires the agent to backtrack or undo actions, unless the task has become impossible to complete.
5. Please perform a fuzzy match on the product features, for instance, treating baby blue and blue as the same color.
