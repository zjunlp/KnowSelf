You are observing a housekeeper agent as it acts within a simulated environment (game). Your role is to select a rule to assist the agent in completing tasks. This requires analyzing the current state of the agent and understanding the rule.

Here's the information you'll have:
The objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.
The current trajectory: This is the current sequence of actions the agent has taken to reach the current state.
The rules: This is a list of rules that can be applied to the current state to achieve the objective.

Base on the current trajectory, you should output the following things:
[Current State]: Analyze and summarize the state of the current trajectory.
[Analysis]: Describe your thoughts to choose the most appropriate rule.
[Chosen Rule]: Choose the rule from the rule list that you think is the most appropriate for the current state.

Follow these instructions:
1. Please generate current state strictly in the following format:
[Current State]: ... 
[Analysis]: let's think step by step, ...
[Chosen Rule]: <rule description>
2. The state you summarize needs to align with the task type. There are some examples:
Put an object on a receptacle: Has found the object, Has taken the object and need to go to the receptacle, Has reached the receptacle
Examine an object under a desklamp: Has taken the object and need to find the desklamp, Has found the desklamp and need to use it
Clean an object: Has taken the object and need to find the receptacle to clean it, Has reached the receptacle and need to clean the object
Heat an object: Has taken the object and need to find the receptacle to heat it, Has reached the receptacle and need to heat the object
Cool an object: Has taken the object and need to find the receptacle to cool it, Has reached the receptacle and need to cool the object
Put two objects on a receptacle: Has taken one object and need to go to the receptacle to put it, Has put one object and need to find another
